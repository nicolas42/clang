I'm going to try to make an expanding array system whereby I can relatively easily translate the code between different datatypes.

Specifically I want to try to find out if I can use a typedef to change the type of the datatypes

Another system might be needed for structs

STRIDE
I could do this with a stride field

or all the functions could be switch statements - inefficient.  but then again this is to make me program faster, not the program

CHAR TYPE


Printing
A generic type breaks the print system which everybody uses.  I would have to make my own print commands
